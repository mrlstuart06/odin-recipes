                Spray the air fryer basket with olive oil spray or line with a parchment
                liner to avoid sticking.

            <li>Remove crust from the can, and cut in half. Shape each piece of dough into
                a circle and crimping up the edges to form a crust. Make sure it'll fit
                in your air fryer basket. Carefully transfer one pizza crust to the air
                fryer basket and spray lightly with olive oil spray.

                and sprinkle with 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Top with 7 pepperoni slices
                and half of the onion slices. Sprinkle with basil and red pepper flakes,
                if using.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>

                7 to 9 minutes. Keep in mind that cooking times may vary depending on the
                brand and size of your air fryer, so check frequently to be sure nothing
                overcooks or burns. Repeat procedure with the second pizza crust. Serve hot.
