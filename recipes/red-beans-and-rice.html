    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This has to be <strong>one</strong> of my most favourtie <em> Mexican style</em> dishes, which I sourced online
        and changed some of the ingedients to give it that extra kick.</p>
    <p>This dish will really get your taste buds tingling, with lovely sausage meat soaked in a beautiful tomoto sauce
        with plenty os spices to ramp that taste and heat up.
    </p>
    <p>This lovely dish can be prepared on the stove as per the following cooking method, or my favourite method which
        really unlocks some extra flavour is switch to using a <strong>slow cooker</strong>
        which I would reccomend cooking for a minimum of <em>six hours</em>.</p>
